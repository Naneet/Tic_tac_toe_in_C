Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game!

Game Rules
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

Board Numbering
The board is numbered as follows:

7  |  8  |  9 

4  |  5  |  6 

1  |  2  |  3 

You may enter the number to place 'X' or 'O' in your turn.

How to Start the Game
To start the game, you will be asked to choose 'X' or 'O'. Enter your choice and press Enter.

Enjoy the game!
